However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. \"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\" Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. \"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.\" Mr. Bennet made no answer. \"Do you not want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife impatiently. \"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\" This was invitation enough. \"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.\" \"What is his name?\" \"Bingley.\" \"Is he married or single?\" \"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\" \"How so? How can it affect them?\" \"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\" \"Is that his design in settling here?\" \"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"",
    
    "11": "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?' So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.",
    
    "84": "It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips. The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.",
    
    "103": "In the year 1872, the house Number 7, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814, was inhabited by Phileas Fogg, Esq. He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little was known, except that he was a perfect gentleman and one of the finest gentlemen in the high society of England. People said that he resembled Byron‚Äîat least that his head was Byronic; but he was a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without growing old. Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner. He was never seen on 'Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the counting-rooms of the 'City'; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen's Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts. He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution, the Artisan's Association, or the Institution of Arts and Sciences.",

The buoyant step, the sparkling eye, the joyous laugh, the heart beating quick with anticipated pleasure‚Äîthese are the sweet companions of youth and spring. But oh! how different, how sadly different, are the feelings of autumn! The tree that in spring shot forth its green leaves with such luxuriant beauty, now stands clothed in yellow, russet, and brown, and soon its leafy honors will be gone. Nature seems to be putting on her shroud. The flowers that bloomed so gaily in the summer sun are either dead or dying. Even the hearty old oak seems to shiver as the cold winds whistle through its branches. And if such is the melancholy change in the face of nature, what must be the feelings of the human heart as it contemplates the shortness and uncertainty of life! Time rolls on with silent but sure step, and we are borne along upon its tide, whether we will or not. Youth, with its roses and its joys, passes away like a pleasant dream; and we wake to find ourselves in the midst of the stern realities of life, with all its cares and troubles and disappointments.",
    
    "46": "Christmas Eve, and twelve of the clock. 'Now they are all on their knees,' An elder said as we sat in a flock By the embers in hearthside ease. We pictured the meek mild creatures where They dwelt in their strawy pen, Nor did it occur to one of us there To doubt they were kneeling then. So fair a fancy few would weave In these years! Yet, I feel, If someone said on Christmas Eve, 'Come; see the oxen kneel, In the lonely barton by yonder coomb Our childhood used to know,' I should go with him in the gloom, Hoping it might be so. The time was neither wrong nor right. I might have seen it all in dream For any happy sight To make a person's heart serene; A pleasure to be born, Wherein the kindly earth supplies Each creature's want, and tries To make existence sweet to all, And spread a sense of peace and good Through every dwelling small."

The art of typing involves developing muscle memory and finger coordination that allows you to transcribe thoughts into written words efficiently. Regular practice with diverse texts helps build familiarity with common letter combinations, punctuation patterns, and word structures found in English literature.

Focus on maintaining proper posture with your feet flat on the floor, back straight, and wrists in a neutral position. Position your fingers on the home row keys and use the correct finger for each key. Start slowly and emphasize accuracy over speed - proper technique will naturally lead to increased velocity over time.

As you practice, pay attention to common words and letter combinations. Many English words share similar patterns, and recognizing these will help you type more fluidly. Practice with various types of text including dialogue, descriptive passages, and different punctuation marks to become a well-rounded typist.

Remember that consistent practice is key to improvement. Even short daily sessions can lead to significant gains in both speed and accuracy. Set realistic goals and track your progress to stay motivated on your typing journey.`;
